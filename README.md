🧠 Overview

Nexus.com is an Agentic AI-powered platform designed to contribute toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — specifically addressing Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3), and Waste Management (SDG 12).

Our platform uses intelligent agents to connect resources, NGOs, and individuals, ensuring optimized food distribution, efficient waste management, and accessible health solutions for all.

💡 Inspiration

We were inspired by the growing global issues of hunger, food wastage, and healthcare inequality. Millions of people still suffer due to inefficient resource management. Our team wanted to build a smart ecosystem that bridges these gaps using AI and automation.

🚀 Problem We Solve

🍽️ Reducing food waste by redirecting excess food to those in need.

🏥 Promoting good health by connecting users to NGOs and wellness resources.

🌱 Managing waste effectively through data-driven insights and AI-based suggestions.
